#Find your workout!#

This project aims to satisfy all gym/calisthenics/yoga/mma-trainees etc.. with huge bank of workout routines.
By now 90% of workouts are by me, but I believe that anyone will contribute and add their own workouts.

Project isn't finished. On the list todo:

  - Add more and more workouts since that is the point of the project
  - Add some more pages like 'exercise instructions videos' or 'diets'
  - Improve site visually
  
Ideas to Add:

  - Diet plans or at least dinner ideas at some page.
  - Timers and stopwatches (not essential)
  - Some minigames like push-ups with keyboard idk.
